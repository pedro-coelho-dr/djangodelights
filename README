This is the capstone project for codecademy´s 'Build Python Web Apps with Django' Skill Path

This is a Tapioca restaurant inventory and reports tracker.

I wont further develop this project, it has really simple html/css. it was just a practice for the course.

Later on I will try to deploy this site into azzure for practice.
