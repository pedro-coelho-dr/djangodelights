This is a Tapioca restaurant inventory and reports tracker.

Tapiocas are a popular street food in Brazil. They are made from tapioca flour, which is hydrated to form a grainy dough. This dough is then spread into a thin layer on a hot griddle, cooking into a soft, slightly chewy crepe-like bread. These sandwiches are typically filled with sweet or savory ingredients, offering a gluten-free alternative to traditional sandwiches.
